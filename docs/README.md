SymBot is a user friendly, self-hosted and automated DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) cryptocurrency bot solution. Create and manage your bots entirely from your web browser or with simple built-in APIs. Best of all, your exchange credentials and keys always remain in your hands... not any other third-party.

## Requirements

- Linux, MacOS, or Windows based system
- Node.js must be installed on your system
- MongoDB installed or a cloud host provider
- Access to a cryptocurrency exchange such as Binance or Coinbase
- Reliable high-speed internet connection

**NOTE:** Trading requires your system and internet connection to be running 24/7. Any interruption could result in missed trades, signals, etc.


## Installation

If you would rather run SymBot using Docker then skip this section and go to the [Docker Installation](#installation-docker) below.


1. Open a command line terminal
2. Change directory to where SymBot files are located
3. Type: `npm install`
4. Wait until all packages are downloaded and installed
5. Modify the app and bot configuration files as necessary (see below)
6. Type: `npm start`. You can also use `npm start consolelog` to display all logging to the console for testing purposes. The same information is also logged to files in the `logs` directory
7. Open a web browser and type: http://127.0.0.1:3000

### Recommended additional steps (optional)

To have SymBot run in the background it is recommended to use the Node.js process manager called **pm2**. Here's how to use it:

1. Install **pm2** by typing: `npm install pm2 -g`
2. Create a file called `ecosystem.config.js` and place the below configuration into it:
```
module.exports = {

	apps: [
			{
				name: 'symbot',
				namespace: 'symbot',
				script: '/home/symbot/symbot.js',
				kill_timeout: 8000,
				max_memory_restart: '1000M'
			}
		  ]
}
```
3. Replace `/home/symbot/symbot.js` with the actual location where SymBot resides on your server and save the file
4. Tell **pm2** to start SymBot with a one time only command by typing: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`
5. Type: `pm2 save` to save the configuration
6. If you don't already have **pm2** starting at system boot time, type this with root privileges: `pm2 startup`. Then type: `pm2 save`

SymBot will now start automatically even when the system is rebooted. With the above configuration **pm2** will monitor SymBot and if memory exceeds roughly one gigabyte, a kill signal will be sent to SymBot. **pm2** will wait eight seconds before terminating the process to give SymBot some time to safely shut itself down. **pm2** will then start SymBot again. You can change those settings to suit your own server requirements and needs.

## Installation (Docker)

Docker can be a great way to get SymBot up and running fast with all the necessary dependencies such as MongoDB.

The Docker build files can be modified as necessary, but should only be done if you're familiar with how they work. Running SymBot under Docker is considered experimental and performing any upgrades could cause unexpected issues.

1. Open a command line terminal
2. Change directory to where SymBot files are located
3. Open the **app.json** configuration file and set `mongo_db_url` to `mongodb://symbot:symbot123@database/symbot`
4. Make any additional changes to the app and bot configuration files as necessary (see below)
5. Change directory to `docker` in the same location where SymBot files are located
6. Type: `docker-compose -p symbot up -d --build`
7. Wait for Docker to build everything and all containers to start
8. Open a web browser and type: http://127.0.0.1:3000

Mongo Express is also installed which can be used to access MongoDB visually by opening a web browser to  http://127.0.0.1:3010

## Configuration

These files are located in the `config` directory

- **app.json**

	- `password` is the password used to login to the SymBot web portal. The default password is "admin".

	- `api_key` is a UUID v4 value that is randomly generated the first time SymBot starts. It is used to make API calls to SymBot. This can be set to most any string value you choose.

	- `web_server` contains settings for the SymBot web server. The default port is 3000.

	-	`bots` contains start condition keys and descriptions such as `asap` and `api`. The keys should never be changed after the initial start of SymBot or they will not match previous bots and deals.

	- `telegram` contains an optional Telegram token id and user id to send SymBot notifications to. This includes system warnings such as detected connectivity issues, bot and deal start / stops, and more! You must first create a Telegram bot with `@BotFather` to use (see below).

	- `mongo_db_url` is the URL to your MongoDB instance.

		- WARNING: If you run multiple instances of SymBot using the same database you will mess up your bots!
		- For quick set up, create a free account at https://cloud.mongodb.com and copy the URL given into the app config. It begins with something like: mongodb+srv://
		- For better security running your own local database is recommended

	- `signals` contains a section to use signals with SymBot. There is a 3CQS signals section by default. If you have an API key just copy it there or create an account at https://www.3CQS.com to get one.
	

- **bot.json**

	- This contains all default settings for your bot and exchange information. For test purposes, always leave `sandBox: true`.
	- Valid exchanges include binance, binanceus, coinbase, and many others. SymBot uses the ccxt library so if the exchange is supported, you should be able to connect to it
	- Most bot settings do not need to be set here since they can be set when creating a bot in the web view

- **server.json**

	- This file is created the very first time SymBot is started. It contains an automatically generated UUID v4 `server_id`. The primary purpose is to ensure if there are ever multiple instances of SymBot running, they do not accidentally conflict with the database used. When SymBot starts it will compare the `server_id` value in this file to the database entry. If they do not match, SymBot will shut down. 
	- This file should never be copied to another folder or server if you plan to run additional instances of SymBot, or manually edited unless you have a good reason to do so.


## Telegram Setup

Using Telegram with SymBot is a great way to know when bot deals start and finish, but also getting notifications when issues are detected, such as being unable to connect to your exchange.

You just need to create a Telegram bot with `@BotFather`. Here are some simple steps on how to do that:

1. Open a Telegram chat with `@BotFather`
2. Once there you may need to type or click on `/start`
3. Type: `/newbot`
4. Choose a name that will be displayed when you receive messages from Telegram. For simplicity, just use: **SymBot**. This does not need to be unique to Telegram.
5. Now you need to choose a unique Telegram username. This can be just about any string value, but it must end in the word **bot**. For example: **MySymBotServer123_bot**
6. If the username you chose was not already taken, then you should receive a token that looks something like: **12345:AbCdEfG_123Abc**
7. Open a chat with your new bot **MySymBotServer123_bot** (use the actual name of your bot)
8. Type or click on `/start`
9. Copy your Telegram bot token into the SymBot **app.json** configuration file. You must also enter your own Telegram id or SymBot will not allow messages to be sent. If you don't know your Telegram id, open a chat with `@userinfobot`
10. Restart SymBot 

## API Information

Take more control of your bots and deals using SymBot APIs. You can easily enable or disable bots and start deals using triggers or signals from 3CQS, TradingView, your own custom scripts and strategies, or from any of your other favorite providers.

## Resetting SymBot

##### *** CAUTION *** This will purge all data from the SymBot database!

If you want to reset the SymBot database for any reason, you can do so only from the command line. It will first ask to confirm, then display a reset code you must enter, and confirm again.

1. Stop any running instances of SymBot
2. Type: `npm start reset` (or `node ./symbot.js reset`)
